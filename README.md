* timed quiz
* time/point penalty for incorrect answers

* ability view and clear highscores 

## Installation
* I started out by making the HTML page
* after that I used CSS to style to page
* when I had the HTML and CSS basics done I started on the JavaScript
* in the JavaScript file I started by creating variable to go with the classes and ids in HTML
* then I generated a variable to hold the questions and answers
* after that I set up a series of functions to start the quiz, generate questions, check answers, save highscore, show highscores, etc
* when that was all done I replaced the question placeholder with real questions and styled the page with CSS to make it look better
